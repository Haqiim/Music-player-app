# Music-player-app

This is a simple music player application.
It music files are stored in the root directory and bound to objects placed in an array.
During this project, I learned about the html audio element methods.
It's fun working on this.
I'm later going to build a backend and a database so I have a better place to store the music files.
Also, I'm going to add a feature that allows a user to add songs from their devices.

Have a lovely day...................                   :)
